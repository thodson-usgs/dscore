D-score: the decomposed score
=============================================

What is D-score?
-----------------------
D-score is a framework for evaluating and scoring models by way of orthogonal decompositions;
a classic example being the decomposition of mean squared error (MSE) into bias variance.
Orthogonal decompositions are advantageous for two reasons.
First, they are easy to interpret. When performing model inference with linear regression, it is important that the explantory variables are orthogonal;
otherwise it becomes difficult to ascertain how each variable affects the outcome:
some variables may act through other variables and model inferences can become unstable.
Similarly, when performing inference with other types of models
Second, when combined with other orthogonal decompositions, the resulting components are also orthogonal.
If each component represents a concept, then simple decompositions can be combined to represent more complex concepts,
just like words.
The result is an expressive language through which to interrogate models and data.
